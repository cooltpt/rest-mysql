# REST-MYSQL

This is an example of a generic REST service wrapper using NodeJS/Express

1. Edit the credentials, etc for the DB connection
2. Setup the tables that you want to be REST-ified
3. The server expects the 1st field of the table to be the PK
4. Search for FIXME in the code for places to modify
